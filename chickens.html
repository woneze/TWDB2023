      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a>
      species that are originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially
      hybridized with other wild species of junglefowls (the grey junglefowl,
      Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms
      for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
      that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen,
      and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens
      primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as
      pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still
      practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and
      for eggs are layers.

      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
      There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore and
      religion, and in language and literature.

      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of
      within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found
      in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
      Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern
      Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC,
      with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land
      between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
      III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century
      BC.[7][8]
